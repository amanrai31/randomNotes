## Authentication VS Authorization
- Authentication is about making sure the user is who they say they are. You're proving your identity with something you have like a username and password.
- Authorization is the next step. Once a user's identity is confirmed, authorization decides what parts of the application they are allowed to use.

1. `fileName!:string` - Filename is not nullable.
