## Github (git stash and git stash pop)
Suppose I am on main branch and i want the changes done by me on main branch to be transfered on some other branch, then-
- On main branch (or whatever branch it is i.e.- first branch)--- git stash
- Change your branch (go to the second one)
- git stash pop. 

## Authentication VS Authorization
- Authentication is about making sure the user is who they say they are. You're proving your identity with something you have like a username and password.
- Authorization is the next step. Once a user's identity is confirmed, authorization decides what parts of the application they are allowed to use.
